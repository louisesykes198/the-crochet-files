## Debug Off

The project uses an option called DEBUG to help keep the site safe when it is live. This is disabled in production so that sensitive data is not displayed if an issue occurs. Additional security options are enabled when DEBUG is turned off, such as mandating HTTPS and protecting cookies. These help to keep user data protected. When working locally on your PC (DEBUG enabled), these options are disabled to make testing and development easier.

# 🧰 Validators

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Further Testing

To ensure cross-browser compatibility, the website was tested across multiple web browsers, including **Google Chrome**, **Microsoft Edge**, and **Safari**. It was also viewed on a range of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, as well as mobile devices including the **Samsung Galaxy A12**, **Samsung Galaxy S22**, and **iPhone SE**. Additionally, friends and family members were invited to review the website and its documentation to identify potential bugs or user experience issues.

# Unit Testing


## 🧪 Testing
Unit tests were written using Django’s built-in TestCase class to ensure key functionality works correctly across the application. All tests were run using the command python manage.py test.

### ✅ Tests Overview

**Model Test** – ProjectModelTest
Verifies that a Project instance can be created successfully and that the name field is stored and retrieved correctly.

**Form Test** – CommentFormTest
Checks that the CommentForm accepts valid input and passes form validation, ensuring the comment field works as intended.

**Authentication Test** – UserAuthTest
Confirms that a test user can log in using the login view. It performs a POST request and follows the redirect to ensure a 200 OK status code is returned, indicating a successful login.

**Security Test** – SecurityTest
Verifies that DEBUG is set to False in a production environment. While DEBUG is currently True during local development, conditional logic is in place to enable important security features in production:

if not DEBUG:
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    ...
else:
    # Local development settings
    SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
This setup ensures HTTPS and secure cookie settings are applied when the project is deployed.

### ✅ Test Results
