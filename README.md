## 🎨 Design & Branding  

### **Logo**

The logo features the text "The Crochet Files" written in a stylish, handwritten script font that gives off a cozy and personal feel. The text is in black against a light blue background, enhancing readability while maintaining a soft, welcoming aesthetic. The playful and artistic style of the font conveys a sense of creativity, fitting well with the handmade, crafty vibe typically associated with crochet.

![image](docs/logo.png)

### **Colour Scheme**  

The Crochet Files features a soft and inviting color palette that reflects the cozy, handcrafted essence of crochet. The site’s background uses a calming pastel blue (#C3E4F8), creating a gentle and welcoming atmosphere.

Content is organized using clean white cards (#FFFFFF) for clarity and contrast. Project cards are enhanced with a delicate pale pink dotted border (#FCDDE8), adding a subtle touch of charm and warmth that complements the overall pastel theme.

Each project card includes three pastel-colored buttons designed for clarity and accessibility:

- View Patterns: A light blue button that invites users to explore more.

- Edit: A soft yellow button that adds a cheerful, approachable tone for updates.

- Delete: A gentle pink button that maintains visual harmony while signaling caution.

This carefully curated palette ensures a cohesive, soothing, and user-friendly experience, aligning perfectly with the comforting and creative spirit of the crochet community. 

![image](docs/colour.png)

### **Typography** 

The Crochet Files uses a combination of two fonts — Rock Salt and Quicksand — to reflect both personality and readability throughout the site.

Rock Salt:
This playful, hand-drawn font brings a handcrafted, whimsical vibe to the site. Inspired by real handwriting with a slightly rough texture, it's perfect for headings or branding elements that need a personal, artsy touch, fitting the handmade spirit of crochet.

![image](docs/logo.png)

Quicksand:
A clean, rounded sans-serif font that’s modern, friendly, and easy to read. Quicksand is used for body text and content areas, providing excellent readability while maintaining a soft and approachable look that complements the cozy aesthetic of the platform.

![image](docs/navbar.png)

Together, these fonts strike a balance between charm and clarity — one expressive and craft-inspired, the other smooth and practical — enhancing the overall user experience with both style and substance.

### **Layout**

### **Accessibility**  

Accessibility has been a key focus during the development of The Crochet Files, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can comfortably navigate and enjoy the website. Several strategies were implemented to create an inclusive experience:

Text Contrast

High Contrast: The site follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by maintaining strong contrast between text and background elements, making content easier to read for users with visual impairments such as low vision or color blindness.

Color Scheme: A soft pastel palette is used thoughtfully, with careful attention to contrast ratios. This ensures that all text remains legible and content stands out clearly against background colors.

Alt Text for Images

Descriptive Alt Text: All images across the website — including project images and category sections — feature meaningful alternative (alt) text. This provides helpful descriptions for users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

Contextual Relevance: Alt text is kept concise yet descriptive, helping users understand the purpose and content of each image without visual input.

Keyboard Navigation Support

Keyboard Accessibility: The site is fully navigable using a keyboard alone. Users can move through links, buttons, and form fields using the Tab key, and activate them using the Enter key.

Focus Indicators: Clear visual focus indicators (such as outline borders) are provided to show which element is currently selected, helping users who navigate without a mouse.

Accessible Forms: All forms — including login, registration, project submission, and editing forms — are properly labeled and structured to be easily usable with a keyboard.

By implementing these features, The Crochet Files aims to provide a welcoming and accessible experience for all users, regardless of ability.

## 🗄️ Database & Backend

### 🧩 Data Structure & Relationships

#### 📐 Database Design Process

The database for **Crochet Files** was carefully structured to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. The design process followed three key phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis** – Understanding the needs of the platform
2. **Data Structuring** – Defining tables and their relationships
3. **Normalisation** – Eliminating redundancy and enforcing integrity

---

#### 📋 Requirements Analysis

The database was designed to support the following core functionalities:

- Users can share crochet projects.
- Users can like and comment on projects.
- Projects are organized by category and difficulty.
- Only registered users can upload, comment, and like projects.

---

#### 🧱 Data Tables & Core Entities

Each major feature is represented by a dedicated table:

| Entity         | Purpose                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**       | Stores user credentials and authentication info       |
| **Project**    | Stores crochet project details                        |
| **Category**   | Organizes projects into types like scarves, hats, etc.|
| **Comment**    | Allows users to comment on projects                   |
| **Like**       | Tracks which users have liked which projects          |

---

#### 🔁 Relationships Between Tables

- **One-to-Many**:
  - A **User** can create many **Projects**
  - A **Category** can include many **Projects**

- **Many-to-Many**:
  - A **User** can like many **Projects**, and a **Project** can be liked by many users (via the **Like** table)

</details> 

---

#### 🧹 Normalisation for Integrity

The database is normalised up to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:

- **1NF**: Each field contains atomic values
- **2NF**: All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes

Example: Category names are stored once in the Category table and referenced using foreign keys across related tables.

### 👤Reviews 

**Lindsey** - The layout of the Crochet Files Project site is beautiful and easy to navigate. 
The minimalist design lets the patterns shine, and everything is neatly organized into categories. 
I found what I needed in seconds!

**Sarah M** - From the homepage to the downloads section, everything is thoughtfully laid out. 
The structure makes it easy to follow a crochet journey, and I loved the featured project highlights on the front page

**Gemma** - Great patterns and very well-organized files. Loved the aesthetic and how easy everything was to download and follow

**Netti** - The site is well-organized and easy to navigate, and I’ve enjoyed exploring the patterns. 
That said, I think it would be even better with a user profile option—somewhere to save favorites, track progress, or keep notes. 
It’s a small thing, but it would make the experience feel more personal

**Sarah R** - The visual layout is creative without being overwhelming. 
I especially liked the little visual previews of each pattern—made browsing super enjoyable. 
A lot of care went into the design.
