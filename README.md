### **Accessibility**  

Accessibility has been a key focus during the development of The Crochet Files, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can comfortably navigate and enjoy the website. Several strategies were implemented to create an inclusive experience:

Text Contrast

High Contrast: The site follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by maintaining strong contrast between text and background elements, making content easier to read for users with visual impairments such as low vision or color blindness.

Color Scheme: A soft pastel palette is used thoughtfully, with careful attention to contrast ratios. This ensures that all text remains legible and content stands out clearly against background colors.

Alt Text for Images

Descriptive Alt Text: All images across the website ‚Äî including project images and category sections ‚Äî feature meaningful alternative (alt) text. This provides helpful descriptions for users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

Contextual Relevance: Alt text is kept concise yet descriptive, helping users understand the purpose and content of each image without visual input.

Keyboard Navigation Support

Keyboard Accessibility: The site is fully navigable using a keyboard alone. Users can move through links, buttons, and form fields using the Tab key, and activate them using the Enter key.

Focus Indicators: Clear visual focus indicators (such as outline borders) are provided to show which element is currently selected, helping users who navigate without a mouse.

Accessible Forms: All forms ‚Äî including login, registration, project submission, and editing forms ‚Äî are properly labeled and structured to be easily usable with a keyboard.

By implementing these features, The Crochet Files aims to provide a welcoming and accessible experience for all users, regardless of ability.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Backend  

### **Data Structure & Relationships** 

##### Database Design for Crochet Files

The database for Crochet Files was designed with efficiency and user-friendliness in mind. The design process was carried out in three key phases:

Requirements Analysis ‚Äì Identifying the Purpose of the Database

Organizing Data into Tables ‚Äì Determining the Database Structure

Normalizing ‚Äì Standardizing the Tables

1. Requirements Analysis ‚Äì Defining the Purpose of the Database
   
In this phase, we focused on understanding the core purpose of the Crochet Files platform. The goal was to create a space where users can share crochet projects, interact through comments and likes, and explore projects organized by category and difficulty.

Key requirements identified through user research and interviews included:

Project Details: Each crochet project should include a title, description, images, and category.

User Interactions: Users must be able to like and comment on projects.

Categorization: Crochet projects should be organized into categories (e.g., blankets, scarves, hats).

User Authentication: Only registered users should be able to like, comment, and upload projects.

2. Organizing Data into Tables ‚Äì Structuring the Database
   
Once the requirements were gathered, we translated them into a database structure. The core entities were identified, and their relationships mapped into database tables.

##### Core Entities:
Users: Stores user details and authentication information.

Crochet Files (Projects): Contains details like title, description, images, and category.

Categories: Organizes crochet projects into predefined types.

Comments: Allows users to comment on projects.

Likes: Tracks which users have liked, which projects.

Each entity corresponds to a database table:

User Table: Contains fields for user details (username, email, password).

Crochet File Table: Stores project details, category reference, user (creator), and images.

Category Table: Contains category names and descriptions.

Comment Table: Links users to crochet projects, storing the comment content.

Like Table: Links users to crochet projects for tracking likes.

##### Relationships:
##### One-to-Many:

A user can create many crochet files.

A category can have many crochet files.

##### Many-to-Many:

A user can like many crochet files, and a crochet file can be liked by many users (handled via the Like table).

This structure ensures that the data is organized efficiently and can scale easily as the platform grows.

3. Normalizing ‚Äì Ensuring Database Integrity
Normalization was carried out to prevent data redundancy and maintain database integrity. The database was normalized to the third normal form (3NF):

First Normal Form (1NF): Ensures atomic values in all fields (no repeating groups).

Second Normal Form (2NF): Eliminates partial dependencies, ensuring all non-key attributes depend fully on the primary key.

Third Normal Form (3NF): Removes transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes.

For example, category data is stored once in the Category table, and user information is referenced using foreign keys in the Crochet Files, Comments, and Likes tables.

##### Backend Architecture
Overview of the Backend
The backend for Crochet Files uses Django and Python, with PostgreSQL as the database. We integrated Cloudinary for image hosting and deployed the app on Heroku.

##### Framework and Tools:
Django: Chosen for its built-in admin interface, powerful ORM, and security features.

Gunicorn: For running the application server on Heroku.

Cloudinary: For secure and scalable image uploads.

Heroku: For hosting and deployment management.

##### Models
Key Models:
User: Customization of Django‚Äôs built-in User model for user authentication.

CrochetFile (Project): Stores details about each crochet project.

Category: Categorizes crochet projects (e.g., blankets, scarves).

Comment: Stores user comments on projects.

Like: Tracks which users have liked, which crochet projects.

##### Field Types:
CharField: Used for names and titles.

TextField: For project descriptions.

ImageField: Used for uploading images to Cloudinary.

ForeignKey: Links to related models (User, Category).

ManyToManyField: Handles the many-to-many relationship between users and projects through the Like model.

##### Relationships:
One-to-Many:

Users can create many crochet files.

Categories can have many crochet files.

Many-to-Many:

Users can like many crochet files, and a crochet file can be liked by many users (via the Like table).

##### Database Design & Schema
Each Django model directly maps to a PostgreSQL table. We‚Äôve optimized performance by:

Adding indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., username, project title).

Using related_name for clear reverse relationships.

Applying normalization best practices to prevent data duplication.

##### Views & URLs
Views:
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for Crochet Files, Comments, and Likes.

##### URL Routing:
URLs are structured clearly for easy navigation, such as:

/files/ ‚Äì List all crochet files.

/files/category/<slug>/ ‚Äì List crochet files by category.

Each URL maps to a specific view function or class-based view.

##### User Authentication & Authorization
Django‚Äôs User System: Handles registration, login, and logout with secure password hashing.

###### Permissions:

Only authenticated users can upload projects, comment, and like files.

Anonymous users can browse but cannot interact.

##### Security
Data Security:

Passwords are securely hashed.

SSL/HTTPS is enforced via Heroku settings.

Cloudinary media uploads are securely authenticated.

##### Input Validation:

Django‚Äôs built-in protections against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

Custom validation for user-uploaded content and form inputs.

##### Deployment

DEPLOYMENT
Please refer to the DEPLOYMENT.md file for:

Creating the database to be used in production
Deploying to Heroku
Setting up Cloudinary for hosting our static and media files

Hosting: The backend is hosted on Heroku. Environment variables (e.g., SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL) are securely stored using Heroku‚Äôs config vars.

Database Hosting: PostgreSQL is provided through Heroku‚Äôs add-ons.

Scalability: The app is ready for scaling with additional dynos and optimized database queries.

##### Logging & Monitoring
Error Tracking: We plan to integrate Sentry or a similar service for enhanced error monitoring.
